def stereo_disparity_score(It, Id, bbox):
    """
    Evaluate accuracy of disparity image.

    This function computes the RMS error between a true (known) disparity
    map and a map produced by a stereo matching algorithm. There are many
    possible metrics for stereo accuracy: we use the RMS error and the 
    percentage of incorrect disparity values (where we allow one unit
    of 'wiggle room').

    Note that pixels in the grouth truth disparity image with a value of
    zero are ignored (these are deemed to be invalid pixels).

    Parameters:
    -----------
    It    - Ground truth disparity image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    Id    - Computed disparity image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    bbox  - 2x2 np.array, bounding box, relative to left image, from top left
            corner to bottom right corner (inclusive).

    Returns:
    --------
    N     - Number of valid depth measurements in It image.
    rms   - Test score, RMS error between Id and It.
    pbad  - Percentage of incorrect depth values (for valid pixels).
